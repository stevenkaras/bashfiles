# What is this?

These are my personal bashfiles.
There are many like them, but these are mine.

Strictly speaking, there's a lot more than just bash here, but the rest is shared configuration files.

## Bash-related features

* Prompt
  * Git integration with the prompt
  * Infinite bash history
  * Colors!
  * Automatic display of hostname if remotely connected
* Others
  * Convenience aliases

## Other program settings

* git
* gdb
* ipython
* irb
* tmux
* psql
* vim (not great work on my part, I don't use it much)
* less

## Common utilities

* SSH - ssh-ca, ssh-acme, ssh-manager
* various helpers

# Installation

Either git clone and run `install_bashfiles.bash`, or:

```
curl https://karas.io/bashfiles | bash
```

which does the exact same.
